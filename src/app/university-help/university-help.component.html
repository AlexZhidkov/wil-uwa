      Questions that the UNIVERSITY’s might ask….

      Topic: The Students
      Which students can apply for the projects?

      How much management of the students is required from us?

      Do we need to screen the students and their suitability for a project before they can be approved?

      What if a student is not happy with their placement?

      If the students create their own project with a business, do we still need to be involved?

      What if a student is accepted for two projects?

      Topic: The Businesses

      Do we need to liaise with the small to medium sized businesses?

      What if there are not enough small to medium sized businesses to cater for the students?

      Ultimately, what will the students get out of working with small to medium sized businesses?

      Topic: Experlio - The Platform

      Why should we use Experlio?

      Once we have approved the student for a project, when will they begin?

      What is the difference between student self sourced and business self sourced?

      Will the platform be open to other universities to use?

      What is the cost outlay?
