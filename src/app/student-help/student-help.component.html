      Topic: Projects

      What is a project?

      Great question! So, a project is basically like a practical subject/unit, we’ve structured our projects to fit
      within your curriculum so you can actually get work experience as part of your degree.
      something that you work towards to achieve a particular outcome. In this case, it will be a collaborative
      enterprise between yourself and the small to medium sized business that you are connected with. For example, the
      business may require a marketing student to create, manage and grow their social media pages, this could be an
      example of a project.
